# Hello! I'm Pablo VÃ¡zquez-Borsetti

I am currently working on neuroinformatics projects using data science tools to address questions about neurodevelopment and neurophysiology.

## ðŸ“‚ My GitHub Projects

Here are some of my neuroinformatics projects:

### [Emotional Vocabulary Develops Earlier Than General Vocabulary](https://github.com/Vazquez-Borsetti/Emotional-vocabulary-develops-earlier-than-general-vocabulary)
R code to fit the Gompertz function, compute its derivative, and model using dummy variables.

### [Oddball Paradigm in the Auditory Cortex: An Open Dataset](https://github.com/Vazquez-Borsetti/oddball-paradigm-in-the-auditory-cortex-an-open-dataset)
An open dataset of neuronal recordings from the auditory cortex using the oddball paradigm.

### [Mouse and Human Comparative Development](https://github.com/Vazquez-Borsetti/mouse-and-human-comparative-development)
Comparative analysis of developmental trajectories in mice and humans.

### [Rat Weight Gain Through Development](https://github.com/Vazquez-Borsetti/rat-weight-gain-through-development)
Python-based analysis of weight gain in rats throughout development.

### [Rat and Human Comparative Development](https://vazquez-borsetti.github.io/rat-and-human-comparative-development)
An interactive visualization comparing rat and human development.  
GitHub repository: [here](https://github.com/Vazquez-Borsetti/rat-and-human-comparative-development).
